            <h2>History of Rock Climbing</h2>
            <p>
                Rock climbing has only been practice as a sport relatively recently, but people have been climbing rock
                faces for millenia prior. Paintings dating back to 200 BC in China depict people rock climbing. Even closer
                to home here in the US, the ancestral puebloan natives are also thought to have been excelent climbers.

                <p>
                Rock climbing has evolved geatly since those times. We use a lot of modern gear and more advanced tools
                to assist in climbing. Most notably, the reasons we climb has evolved, people do it because they can. 
                in the past the ancestral puebloans may have been climbers so they could build their homes that we see
                like at the Cliff Palace of Mesa Verde National Park. Today though, climbing is mostly reserved for sport
                and adventure.

            <h2>Rock Climbing in Utah</h2>
            <p>
                Given that the majority of Utah's population centers in the Salt Lake valley and the Utah are smashed
                right next to the Wasatch mountain range, it should come as no surprise that there are thousands of 
                rock climbing spots within nearly half an hour from anywhere. Some of the best places to go climbing 
                here in the heart of Utah are the Big and Little Cottonwood canyons. These canyons contain smooth steep
                quartzite rock faces that reach several hundred, all contanying thousands of set climbing routes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the earliest climbing in the Cottonwood canyons that we know of dates back to the 1930's, and it 
                isn't till the 1960's and 1970's when some of the more popular routes in the canyons were established.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utah is such a fantastic area for rock climbing, that one of the biggest and most popular rock climbing 
                equipment companies is headquartered out of Salt Lake City. That company being Black Diamond Equipment.
